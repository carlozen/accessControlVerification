# Access Control Verification

#### Carlo Zen 864429

## Task




## To run
The code works well with policies: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7.
If tested with policy 2, it reaches the maximum length of recursion.
If tested with policies 5 and 8, after 10 minutes it is still inside the main recursive call.  

To run: `python main.py` (tested with Python 2.7.15+)
